RunMany is a pet project about making it easy to practice multiple programming languages at once by putting them in a single file.

Right now the python package is built but there is no IDE support, namely no VSC syntax highlighting.

Goals:
- LSP client extension and server to do request forwarding to other language services: https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/embedded-languages
	- Though the request forwarding passthrough is pretty limited - no diagnostics, no autocomplete even from my tests. Built-in languages services is not really an option though.
- Commands list akin to code-runner.executorMap that gets put in global settings.json (Though how does this combine with provided json?)
- Thin debugger wrapper extension so when VSC user presses F5 in .many file it prompts a debug config that just runs it. No actual debugging.
- In reality, package all the above extensions into one big VSC extension so the user only installs extension and pip installs runmany and they are ready to go.
- "marketplace has extensions that can help with .many file" popup thing
- little icon for .many files

These have highlighting but they wouldn't run easily on windows:
Clojure
COBOL
F#
ObjectiveC
Scheme
Swift


These have command issues:
Ada - ideally wouldn't use cd since that changes the cwd
Scala - ideally wouldn't use cd since that changes the cwd - issue with running full file path
